#oFxOSC Final Project 

##What I am currently working on: 
- In PD: change the pitch, loudness, and tempo 
- I noticed so far that I like putting both pitch and loudness numbers louder
- I also changed the tempo to be at metro 100 and noticed instead of a constant tic sound it created more of a faster pattern 

##Next Steps in PD: 
- change pitch numbers to be lower (50) while loudness in high (100)
- change it so pitch and loudness are about the same 
- change it so pitch is higher and loudness is low 
- listen to all three, choose best one, adjust tempo to make it sound best (either 200/100/300 tempo)

##Later in Final: 
- connecting PD with OSC (understanding how that actually works)
- creating cool images with draw function that will eventually connect with my sound 

##End Goal: 
- Have a PD sequencer that has a change in pitch, tempo, and loudness creating a "louder" sound then connecting it to my OSC function making a moving object that viberates or moves in a way that correlates with the music/sound I created
